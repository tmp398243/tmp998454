    @ensure_import PackageModule

This macro ensures that the given package is available and imported.
It attempts to import the package directly, and if that fails, it creates
a temporary environment, installs the package, and then imports it.

Usage:
    Include this script in your project to guarantee a package's availability.

Behavior:
1. Tries to import the package.
2. If import fails:
   a. Creates/activates a temporary shared environment named "ensure-PackageName".
   b. Adds the the package to this environment.
   c. Imports the package from the temporary environment.

Note:
- This script modifies the Julia environment if the package is not initially available.
- The temporary environment is shared, allowing reuse across multiple runs.

Dependencies:
- Pkg (used only if initial import fails)

# Example

For example,
```julia
@ensure_import CoverageTools
```
is equivalent to
```julia
try
    import CoverageTools
catch
    import Pkg
    Pkg.activate("ensure-CoverageTools", shared = true)
    Pkg.add(Pkg.PackageSpec(name = "CoverageTools"))
    import CoverageTools
end
```
