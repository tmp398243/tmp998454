# Documentation[^1]

This directory contains the documentation for our Julia project, built using [Documenter.jl](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/).

## Structure

- `Project.toml`: Defines the dependencies required for building the documentation.
- `make.jl`: The main script that builds the documentation.
- `doctest.jl`: Script for running doctests.
- `src/`: Contains the source files for the documentation.
- `build/`: Stores the results of building the documentation (not committed to repo).

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation locally, run the following command from the project root:

```
make doc
```

This will generate the documentation and output it to the `docs/build` directory.

## Running Doctests

To run the doctests, use:

```
make doctest
```

This ensures that code examples in the documentation are up-to-date and functioning correctly.

## Writing Documentation

Place your documentation files in the `src/` directory. Refer to the [Documenter.jl guide](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/man/guide/) for detailed information on how to write and structure the documentation.

## Deploying

The documentation is automatically built and deployed as part of our CI/CD pipeline. Refer to the project's main README or CI configuration for more details on the deployment process.
